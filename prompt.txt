I'd like to create some visuals to compare a few trends:
1. The growth of open source package ecosystems across various dimensions (number of packages, number of versions, updates, downloads, bandwidth, and percentage of malware)
2. The underlying costs associated with operating the infrastructure and services of package registry services like PyPI, Crates, Rubygems, Maven Central, etc. This includes the staffing and infrastructure costs 
3. The increased expectations of security-related features like malware scanning, Trusted Publishing, code signing, etc.
